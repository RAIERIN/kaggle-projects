Let us take an example to check what happens to a data set with and data set without outliers.\n    \n                              Data without outlier\t\tData with outlier\n                     \n         Data\t\t           1,2,3,3,4,5,4\t\t     1,2,3,3,4,5,400\n \n         Mean\t\t           3.142\t\t             59.714\n\n         Median\t\t           3\t\t                 3\n\n         Standard Deviation    1.345185\t\t             150.057\n\nHere you can see data set with outlier has significantly different mean and standard deviation. In the first scenario, average is 3.14. But with outlier averages to 59.71, This would change the estimate completely.\n \nLet us take a real world example. In a company of 50 employees, 45 people having monthly salary of Rs.6000, 5 scenior employees having monthly sarlary of  Rs.1000000 each. If you calculate the average monthly salary of employees in the company is Rs. 14,500, which will give you the wrong conclusion (majority of employees have lesser than 14.5k salary). But if you take median salary, it is Rs.6000 which is more sense than the average. For this reason median is appropriate measure than mean. \n\nOutlier is a commonly used terminoloy by analysts and data scientists as it needs close attention else it can result in widly wrong estimations. Simply speaking, outlier is an observation that appears far away and diverges from an overall pattern in a sample."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Causes For Outliers\n\n1.
